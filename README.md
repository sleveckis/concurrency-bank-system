# Concurrent Bank Backend in C
A mock banking system that processes hundreds of thousands of transactions via an input file, using the p_threads library for C.

Compile using the makefile, ("make" in a CLI) and run the executeable. Outputs for each account are saved in the output folder. View the input-1.txt file for a list of processed mock bank accounts, the type of transaction, the amount of money processed, and other relevant details.
